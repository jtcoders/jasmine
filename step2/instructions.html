				<h1>Exercise 2</h1>
				<p class="lead">Checking who won</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>In the last exercise, you wrote some functions to control a player. If you weren't able to complete it, don't worry. You can <a href="../step1-solution.zip" download>download and unzip the solution</a>.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, we'll be adding more complex test cases.</p>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>There will be a global Object called <code>goal</code> that contains the current position of the goal as <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> properties:
					<pre><code>console.log(goal.x); // logs 0
console.log(goal.y); // logs 0</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>Write a function called <code>checkWin</code> that checks whether the player has won. A player has won when the player's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates match those of the goal.</li>
				<li><code>checkWin</code> should be called whenever <code>moveRight</code>, <code>moveLeft</code>, <code>moveDown</code>, or <code>moveUp</code> are called.</li>
				<li>The teachers have written a function called <code>renderWin</code>. <code>renderWin</code> should be called if <code>checkWin</code> finds that the player has won.</li>
				<li>In <code>GameSpec.js</code>, write tests for the <code>checkWin</code> function. Remember that you sometimes have to "set the stage" before running the test. You should also be sure to use at least 1 spy.</li>
				<li>In <code>Game.js</code>, write code for <code>checkWin</code>.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Bonus</h3>
			<p>What can you do to improve the game play? Would you randomly set the goal? Would you add an enemy character? How would you test the code? Give it a try!</p>
